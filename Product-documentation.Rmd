# Project Documentation

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for developing an inventory system for our school. The system aims to facilitate the efficient and effective management of assets, resources, and infrastructure used by staff and students, such as equipment, supplies, books, and furniture.

In this document, headings are denoted by bold text and underlining, while subheadings are denoted by bold text alone. This convention helps to clearly distinguish different sections and subsections, ensuring ease of navigation and understanding.

The intended audience for this document consists of individuals directly involved in the development of the inventory system. It provides a comprehensive overview of the project's scope, objectives, deliverables, constraints, assumptions, and references.

### Background
The ICT University currently has an inventory system that is divided into two categories: fixed assets and office supplies. However, the focus of interest lies in the fixed assets. In the ICT department, we utilize various equipment such as projectors, HDMI cables, sockets, monitor screens, RJ45 cables, and more. The Finance office conducts an annual inventory of the equipment upon arrival, adding it to the existing stock and assigning a cost to each item. Over time, the value of these assets decreases. When the equipment is used, it is removed from the system.

Each asset or equipment is assigned to a specific user, such as students and lecturers who utilize HDMI cables and projectors during their classes. As each asset has an assigned user, it is essential to track the location of the equipment when it is taken. For instance, when a student borrows equipment from the CISCO lab, they are required to provide their school ID or personal ID so that the university can identify the student responsible for the borrowed item. However, the current system lacks the ability to track the location of these items as they are moved, and there is no identification number assigned to each item. Consequently, the university must rely on manual processes to determine the availability of materials.

To enhance the system, several improvements are necessary. Firstly, each item should be assigned a unique identification number. Additionally, the system should store both the normal location of an item and its current location when it has been borrowed. When an individual borrows an item, they should provide an ID and sign it out. Upon returning the item, they sign it back in. By implementing these changes, the system will be capable of tracking the movement of items, calculating depreciation values, determining the quantity of faulty items, and providing an accurate count of items remaining in stock.

The inventory system currently operates on a Windows machine and is used locally within the university.

### Objectives

1. Implement an identification numbering system: Assign unique identification numbers to each item in the inventory to facilitate tracking and management.

2. Track item locations: Develop a functionality that allows the system to record and update the normal location of each item as well as its current location when it is borrowed.

3. Enable user accountability: Require users to provide identification (such as a school ID or personal ID) when borrowing equipment, ensuring responsibility and accountability for borrowed items.

4. Automate check-in and check-out processes: Implement a system that allows users to sign items out when borrowed and sign them back in upon return, enabling efficient tracking of item movements.

5. Calculate depreciation value: Incorporate functionality to track the depreciation of assets over time, providing insight into the value and condition of equipment.

6. Maintain accurate inventory records: Ensure that the system maintains up-to-date and accurate records of available stock, including the quantity of faulty items and the remaining quantity in stock.

7. Improve reporting capabilities: Generate comprehensive reports on inventory levels, asset usage, and trends to facilitate informed decision-making and resource planning.

8. Enhance system usability: Develop a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate, facilitating efficient access to inventory information.

9. Local system deployment: Optimize the inventory system to run on Windows machines and operate locally within the ICT University.

These objectives aim to address the limitations of the current system and improve the management and tracking of assets and resources within the ICT University.
